# 🔐 Cyber Threat Forecasting Using TCN + ARIMA Hybrid Model

A complete time-series forecasting project that predicts monthly cyber threat incident counts using a hybrid of **Temporal Convolutional Networks (TCN)** and **ARIMA**. It includes rich exploratory data analysis, domain insights, and hybrid modeling using real-world cybersecurity incident data.

## 📁 Dataset

A real-world CSV file containing:
- `Date` of incident  
- `Location`, `Industry`, `Victim`, `Actor`, etc.  
- `Type` and `Sub-Type` of the cyberattack  
> 🔍 The dataset is anonymized and used for academic demonstration only.
